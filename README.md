test.py -- using one of the two given SPARQL commands; I wrote python code that created a graph data, parse in an RDF file hosted on the Internet, stored a SPARQL query in a python var and created a SQL command.

test_2.py -- using second of the two given SPARQL commands; I wrote python code that created a graph data, parse in an RDF file hosted on the Internet, stored a SPARQL query in a python var and created a SQL command.

test_3.py -- is a combination of test.py & tset_2.py with a python function that creates SQL comands, new SPARQL querys based on new graphs, and prints rows of the SPARQL command to check if populating correctly
